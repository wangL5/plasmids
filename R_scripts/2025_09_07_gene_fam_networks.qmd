## Gene family networks

Gene families derived from PlasX analysis: pfam, cog, or de novo mmseqs clustered gene families

Question: Are there any gene families that are more represented in a detection group?

Part of the larger question to understand why genomad and plasx were unable to detect 2 clusters of CAMI2 plasmids

Will use network analysis to tease out patterns in accession,

```{r}

gene_fam_metadata = read.csv("gene_fams_metadata.txt", sep="\t")
```
